# Interface
- Group of abstract methods that can be implemented by multiple classes.
- By implementing interfaces you are setting some sort of a contract.that any class which implements these methods, will
definitely have those interface methods.
- Any class which implements interfaces will be forced to implement interface methods.
- We cannot create a objet of an interface.

- every method in interface is public
