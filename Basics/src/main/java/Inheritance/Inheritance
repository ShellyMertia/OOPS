Inheritance
- Inheritance in real life
  1) Inheriting properties / money
  2) Inheriting DNA - Similar in coding

  Advantages of inheritance
  - re-usability
  - Reduction in duplicate code
  - Maintainability becomes easier [ approximation]
  - Extensibility can be true

  We are able to extended the existing the capability of your current class. We already have the
  basics of teh parents plus we can add more things to it.

  - Maintaining hierarchy | grouping things together

  - Is-A relationship
  - Representation on hierarchy in classes is called as Inheritance.
  - Representation of parent - child relationship.

                                      [User]   - { Supper class/ Parent class/ Base class }
    [TA]       [Student]          [Mentor]         [Instructor]   - { Sun/Derived/child class }

- Going upward in hierarchy is called generalization
- Going downward in hierarchy is called specialization.
- Child classes inherit  all attributes of parent but may or may not have there own members.
- Can we inherit private members? Yes private members are inherited.But accessibility of the inherited
    attributes will depends on the access modifier.
- We get the idea of a class just by looking at the hierarchy and no need to look into implementation.
 Thus acheveing abstraction.

 STEPS TO CREATE A OBJECT OF A CHILD CLASS
 - Assume there is no constructor present.



 this, super Keyword
 Both of them can be used to call
 - constructor
 - attribute
 - method


 this keyword is used to call the constructor, the attribute or the method of the current class/object.
 super keyword is for parent class/object.

Constructor telescoping
- prone to error


- If your parent class doesn't have a default constructor, then we need to pass arguments for current
constructor via child class constructor using super keyword.
-super is always the first line of the constructor.
- ability to call parent constructor from child class, is called constructor chaining.
